# IH_Project1
## Resolving Merge Conflicts

1. From the user folder, a directory called "IH_Project1" was created using the **mkdir** command
2. Navigated to the recently created directory using **cd ~/IH_Project1**
3. Executed **git init** to create the local repository. To check that the repository was correctly created, run the command **ls -a** and found that file **.git** existed.
4. Using the command **nano readme.txt**, I created a new text file called readme.txt and modified its content.
5. I created another file called "uniqueiteminmaster.txt" using the same method as above
6. Once the files are created, I allowed git to track them by using the command **git add**
